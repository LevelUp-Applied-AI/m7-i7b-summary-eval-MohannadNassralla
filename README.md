# Module 7 Week B — Integration Task: Summarization & Integrated Evaluation Report

This is the starter repo for the Module 7 Week B Integration Task. **The integrated evaluation report you produce here is the M7 deliverable.**

The full integration guide is at <a href="https://levelup-applied-ai.github.io/aispire-14005-pages/modules/module-7/496c1c2b" target="_blank">the integration guide page</a> — read it first.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
make summarize    # runs full pipeline; first run downloads ~250 MB
```

The first call to `pipeline("summarization", ...)` downloads the model. Plan ~3 minutes for the first run; subsequent runs use cached weights. The full evaluation on 120 articles completes in ~6–8 minutes on CPU after the model is cached.

## What you will produce

Committed:
- `summarize.py` — your implementation
- Updated `README.md` — 1–2 paragraphs documenting model id, corpus version, re-run command (this section is the template; replace it)
- `summary_predictions.csv` — 120 rows with reference, predicted, and per-summary ROUGE
- `summary_metrics.json` — aggregate ROUGE-1/2/L F1
- `integrated-evaluation-report.md` — six-section integrated report (the M7 deliverable). Includes an optional Section 7 (Challenge Extensions) for learners completing challenge tiers — see the integration's learner guide.

**No model file** — pre-trained model loads from Hugging Face Hub at runtime.

## Data

- `data/tech_news_articles.csv` — 1,033 tech / entertainment / digital-culture news articles, curated from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/glnmario/news-qa-summarization" target="_blank">glnmario/news-qa-summarization</a>. The full pool is here for inspection and stretch use; the integration evaluates on the 120-article subset that has reference summaries.
- `data/tech_news_summaries_reference.csv` — 120 reference summaries (one per evaluated article), shipped with the curated dataset (CNN editor-authored summaries from the source dataset).
- `data/tiny_articles_smoke.csv` + `data/tiny_refs_smoke.csv` — 3-row CI smoke fixtures (articles and references in separate files, matching the real-data schema).

## Make targets

```bash
make summarize    # full pipeline against the 120-article evaluation set
make smoke        # CI-only target — 3-row fixture
make clean        # remove generated outputs
```

## Submission

Open a Pull Request from your working branch into `main`. The autograder runs `make smoke` against the 3-row fixture and validates artifact schemas. PR description requirements are in the integration guide.

# Tech News Summarization & Evaluation Engine

This component implements an evaluation harness for evaluating abstractive text summarization models against an executive tech news corpus. It processes structural articles, generates concise summaries via sequence-to-sequence neural architectures, and automatically scores target variations across standardized n-gram overlap metrics.

## Model Reference
* **Model Profile:** `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-6-6`
* **Description:** A compact, distilled variation of the standard sequence-to-sequence `facebook/bart-large-cnn` architecture. It leverages a 6-layer encoder paired with a 6-layer decoder, explicitly fine-tuned on the CNN/DailyMail news dataset to output highly structured, fluid news synopses with reduced latency overhead compared to full parameter foundations.

## Corpus Verification
* **Evaluation Data:** This engine benchmarks performance against **120 structural technology and computing articles** extracted from the M6 corpus distribution.
* **Ground Truth:** Evaluation uses curated human reference summaries configured in `data/tech_news_summaries_reference.csv` to capture structural news elements, core operational metrics, and explicit executive assertions.

## Reproducibility Execution
To clear execution caches, configure dependencies within your localized virtual environment, pull the pre-trained weights from the Hugging Face Hub, and run inference across the full 120-article test set, execute:

```bash
make summarize
